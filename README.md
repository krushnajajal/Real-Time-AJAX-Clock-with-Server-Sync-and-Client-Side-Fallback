Welcome to the Real-Time AJAX Clock project! This repository showcases a unique implementation of a clock that combines server-side accuracy with client-side resilience.

Key Features:
Server-Synced Time: Fetches the current time from a PHP backend to ensure accuracy.
Client-Side Fallback: If the server is unreachable, the clock continues to update using the client's local time.
Automatic Drift Correction: The clock syncs with the server every 30 seconds, correcting any drift that may occur.
Visual Feedback: Color-coded indicators provide real-time status updates (green for synced, red for offline).
Accessibility: Designed with ARIA attributes to ensure compatibility with screen readers.
Why This Project?
In a world where accurate timekeeping is essential, this project demonstrates how to effectively combine server and client technologies to create a reliable time display. It serves as a practical example for developers looking to understand AJAX, PHP, and real-time data synchronization.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
Backend: PHP
AJAX: Fetch API for asynchronous requests
Getting Started:
Clone this repository and run the index.php file on a PHP server to see the real-time clock in action. The project is lightweight and requires minimal setup, making it perfect for both beginners and experienced developers.
